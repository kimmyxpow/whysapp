### ðŸ“¦ WhysApp

**WhysApp** is a simple desktop wrapper for WhatsApp Web. It's not a full-featured clientâ€”just a straightforward way to run WhatsApp Web as a desktop app.

I made this for my personal use because I manage multiple WhatsApp numbers, and the official WhatsApp Desktop app doesn't support switching accounts easily. Instead of constantly logging in and out or looking for alternatives, I decided to build my own lightweight clients. If you find it useful too, feel free to use it.

The app is built using [Tauri](https://tauri.app/), so it's lightweight and fast.  
You can download a prebuilt version from the [Releases page](https://github.com/kimmyxpow/whysapp/releases).  
If you know how to use Tauri, you can also build it yourself from source.
